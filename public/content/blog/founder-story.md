# The AlphaBrains Story

By Anjali Sharma, Co-founder

When we started AlphaBrains in 2020, our vision was simple: transform how students learn and prepare for their future. Coming from an engineering background and with 15 years of teaching experience, I saw the need for a more holistic approach to education.

## Our Journey

- Started with 50 students
- Grew to 500+ in first year
- Launched digital platform
- Expanded to multiple locations

Our focus remains on quality education, personalized attention, and building future leaders.
